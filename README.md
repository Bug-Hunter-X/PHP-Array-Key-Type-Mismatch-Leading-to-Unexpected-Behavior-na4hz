# PHP Array Key Type Mismatch

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP related to array keys that are not strictly strings. PHP's loose typing allows for numeric keys to behave unexpectedly, leading to surprising results when merging or comparing arrays. 

The `bug.php` file showcases the problematic code. `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version with explicit type casting or ensuring consistent key types for better code behavior and predictability.
