In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys that are not strictly strings.  PHP's loose typing allows for numeric keys to behave unexpectedly, especially during array merges or comparisons. For instance, if an array has keys 0, 1, 2 and another has keys '0', '1', '2', merging them will result in separate key sets, not a combined array as one might intend.  Similarly, comparing such arrays directly with `==` will yield `false` despite the elements being identical.
